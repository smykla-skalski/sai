## The problem

Removing AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

## Signs of soulless writing

Even technically "clean" text can read as AI-generated if it has:

- Every sentence the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

## Techniques for adding voice

**Have opinions.** React to facts instead of just reporting them. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

**Vary rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they're going. Mix it up.

**Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings. "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

**Use first person when it fits.** "I keep coming back to..." or "Here's what gets me..." signals a real person thinking. First person is not unprofessional.

**Let some mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Tangents, asides, and half-formed thoughts are human.

**Be specific about feelings.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

## Before and after

**Before (clean but soulless):**
> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical. The implications remain unclear.

**After (has a pulse):**
> I genuinely don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans presumably slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle - but I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.
